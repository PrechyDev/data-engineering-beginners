#This script automates the process for getting the current temp and the temp for noon the next day in a particular city.
#It gets data from https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in. Inspect that to get the details.
# This script is from the IBM course on shell scripting (practice project)
# further instructuons can be found on the readme.

curl wttr.in/$city --output $weather_report

#search for all lines containing temperatures
grep Â°C $weather_report > temperatures.txt

#the current temp is in the first line. Extract just the numerical value
